# Guess_game

## Description: Use simplegui to build an interactive guess game
- The game starts immediately when the “Run” button in CodeSkulptor is pressed.
- A game is always in progress. Finishing one game immediately starts another in the same range.
- The game reads guess from the input field and correctly prints it out.
- The game correctly plays “Guess the number” with the range 0 to 100 and prints understandable output messages to the console. 
- The game includes two buttons that allow the user to select the range 0 to 100 or the range 0 to 1000 for the secret number. These buttons correctly change the range and print an appropriate message
- The game restricts the player to a finite number of guesses and correctly terminates the game when these guesses are exhausted. 
- The game varies the number of allowed guesses based on the range of the secret number — seven guesses for range 0 to 100, ten guesses for range 0 to 1000.
