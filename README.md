# Guess_game
## Description: Use simplegui to build an interactive guess game
-The game starts immediately when the “Run” button in CodeSkulptor is pressed.
-A game is always in progress. Finishing one game immediately starts another in the same range.
-The game reads \color{red}{\verb|guess|}guess from the input field and correctly prints it out.
-The game correctly plays “Guess the number” with the range \color{red}{\verb|[0, 100)|}[0, 100) and prints understandable output messages to the console. Play three complete games: 1 pt for each correct game.
-The game includes two buttons that allow the user to select the range \color{red}{\verb|[0, 100)|}[0, 100) or the range \color{red}{\verb|[0, 1000)|}[0, 1000) for the secret number. These buttons correctly change the range and print an appropriate message. (1 pt per button.)
-The game restricts the player to a finite number of guesses and correctly terminates the game when these guesses are exhausted. Award 1 pt if the number of remaining guesses is printed, but the game does not terminate correctly.
- The game varies the number of allowed guesses based on the range of the secret number — seven guesses for range \color{red}{\verb|[0, 100)|}[0, 100), ten guesses for range \color{red}{\verb|[0, 1000)|}[0, 1000).
